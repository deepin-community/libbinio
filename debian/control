Description: Binary I/O stream class library
 The binary I/O stream class library presents a platform-independent way to
 access binary data streams in C++. The library is hardware independent in
 the form that it transparently converts between the different forms of
 machine-internal binary data representation. It further employs no special
 I/O protocol and can be used on arbitrary binary data sources.
